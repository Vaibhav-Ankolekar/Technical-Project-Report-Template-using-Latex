\section{List of Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \LaTeX \ Report Template provides core and advanced concepts of \LaTeX \ .
    \item Our Latex Report Template is designed for  beginners and working professionals.
    \item The \LaTeX \ is a high-quality typesetting system, used for  the documentation of scientific and technical documents.
    \item It is widely used in academia for the  communication and the publication of scientific papers popularly in fields such as economics,  sociology, mathematics, chemistry, physics, engineering, etc.
    \item It also handles the formatting  layout of different structures. The name is stylized as \LaTeX.
    \item The existing word processors have several limitations which can be overcome by LATEX.
\end{itemize}

The main advantages of LATEX over normal word processors are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Professionally crafted layouts are available, which make a document really look as if “printed”.
    \item The typesetting of mathematical formulae is supported in a convenient way.
    \item Users only need to learn a few easy-to-understand commands that specify the logical structure of a document. They almost never need to tinker with the actual layout of the document.
    \item Even complex structures such as footnotes, references, table of contents, and bibliographies can be generated easily.
    \item Free add-on packages exist for many typographical tasks not directly supported by basic LATEX. For example, packages are available to include PostScript graphics or to typeset bibliographies conforming to exact standards.
    \item LATEX encourages authors to write well-structured texts by specifying structure
