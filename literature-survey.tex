        1 & Free and works on all operating systems, 2021 & LaTeX is free and there are a multitude of text editors to choose from for each operating  system. If you create a LaTeX .tex file at work on Windows and resume working on it at home  on your Mac or Linux computer, the file will compile the same regardless.\\
        \hline
        
        2 & Editing, Versioning, Automation and Outputs, 2020 & Software developers commonly use source control systems to track changes to files over time.  LaTeX is very amenable to using Git to track changes to your documents, something that is  difficult to do for documents from a Word Processor \\
        \hline
        
        3 & Focus on Content, 2020 & LaTeX separates content and styling/design, and this is especially true when using templates.  This ensures consistency since the formatting is handled separately and en masse. \\
        \hline
        
        4 & Time Investment, 2019 & When using a word processor, time spent trying to fix a formatting problem is essentially time  wasted; it is unlikely the same problem will arise again. In LaTeX, once you figure out how to  make a formatting change, you now know how to do this forever and it becomes quite natural  given some repetition. \\
        \hline
        
        5 & Longevity, 2019 & Documents written 20 years ago in LaTeX are almost guaranteed to compile today. Compare  this with a document produced using a word processor from 20 years ago, it is likely the  software no longer exists and if it does, it has undergone so many changes that it may not  display the document correctly. \\
