This document contains essential templates required to write technical reports using \LaTeX. This template may be used for the preparation of B.Tech project reports of Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai. Also minimum working examples to create equations, include figure, include table, table of contents symbols list and bibliographic citation in a \LaTeX \ document are provided. \\

Students taking the undergraduate degrees in Engineering at the Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering are required to undertake several a projects and to write them up as reports. This document provides some advice on using \LaTeX \ to typeset these reports. It is also an example of how to go about making a \LaTeX \ document: you should read the source as well as the typeset document in order to see how it was all done. This document originally conformed to the regulations laid down for the project report: it had the correct font size, margins etc. So you could use it as a template for your project report by removing all of our content and inserting your own. You should check with the current course organiser for projects whether this is still true. \\
