\section{Conclusion}

Thus our project â€œ\title" concentrates on the documentation of project reports which includes project title page, certificate etc. The standard formatting constraints for these documents are defined in packages developed under this project, which will thus help the user to complete his/her work in stipulated time and making it less tedious. This template is used by other project groups of Information Technology department of Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering. This template can also be used by other College or Universities by doing some changes in names and college logo.

\section{Future Scope}

In order to make use of class files developed in the project, the basic requirement is that the user must have the sound knowledge of \LaTeX. So to make it more handy, user interface can be developed which will take only the required values as input viz; the content of notice and the packages in the back-end will take care of formatting without the user having to know \LaTeX \ commands.
