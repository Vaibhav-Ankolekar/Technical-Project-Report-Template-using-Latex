\chapter{Problem Definition}

Technical report writing is an important skill, and will stand you in good stead in your future career. It is much more precise than many other forms of writing. A project report is not quite the same as a technical report2 , however it should show the same level of care and attention to detail. \\

MS Word is for general purpose documentation. As against that LaTex is a strongly typed language engineered for technical documentation. In crude sense some of the advantages of using LaTex is the programming kinda approach to putting your stuff in place. Various packages help in creating a sharp and nicely written articles, reports, etc. There are certain commands for many mathematical building blocks. \\

For graphics again we have packages and some more commands. But once you get to know these commands, writing and creating high quality documents is but a walk in a dream. M.S. words does have many facilities, but the format and the way one uses it is very dis-ordered and not so sturdy. Across different versions, many basic properties like alignment, are found to be varying giving one a not so uniform rendering. \\

The proposed system attempts to use LATEX to make documentation of generally used documents like project thesis, reports, notices, etc. in the technical institutes a bit easier. The proposed system will provide class or style files for a technical institute to write

\begin{enumerate}
    \item notice
    \item project reports
\end{enumerate}

The user simply needs to include the package name in his file and use the commands defined in the package to format his documents. Thus, the proposed system will reduce the efforts of the user in formatting the documents.
